# Specs

Specs are formal descriptions of expected behavior — the contract between components, APIs, or systems.

## Key Principles

- **Unambiguous** — A spec eliminates guesswork about what a system should do
- **Testable** — Every spec statement can be verified programmatically
- **Versioned** — Specs evolve alongside the systems they describe

## Common Forms

- API contracts (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas)
- Behavioral specifications (BDD/Gherkin)
- Type-level specifications (TypeScript interfaces, Zod schemas)
