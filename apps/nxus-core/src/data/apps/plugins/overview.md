# Plugins

Plugins are self-contained extensions that add new capabilities to a system without modifying its core.

## Key Principles

- **Isolation** — Each plugin operates independently with well-defined boundaries
- **Discoverability** — Plugins register themselves through a standard interface
- **Lifecycle** — Plugins can be installed, enabled, disabled, and removed at runtime

## Common Patterns

- Hook-based (WordPress, Fastify)
- Module-based (Nx, Webpack)
- Event-driven (VS Code extensions)
