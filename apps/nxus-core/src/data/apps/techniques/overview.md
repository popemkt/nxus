# Techniques

Techniques are repeatable, well-defined methods for solving a specific class of problem.

## Key Principles

- **Actionable** — A technique tells you exactly what to do, step by step
- **Scoped** — Each technique targets a specific problem domain
- **Composable** — Techniques can be combined into larger workflows

## Examples

- Strangler fig pattern for incremental migration
- Feature flags for safe deployments
- Property-based testing for exhaustive validation
