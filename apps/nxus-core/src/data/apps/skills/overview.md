# Skills

Skills are composable units of capability — a defined procedure or technique that can be learned, practiced, and applied in context.

## Key Principles

- **Contextual** — Skills activate based on the situation at hand
- **Composable** — Complex behaviors emerge from combining simple skills
- **Transferable** — Skills can be shared between agents or systems

## Examples

- A coding skill that knows how to write tests for a specific framework
- A debugging skill that traces errors through call chains
- A refactoring skill that applies safe transformations
